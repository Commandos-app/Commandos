# Commandos
Commandos is a GIT Client specialty for multi repositories. But works fine too with just one repository.
It can execute a command on multiple repositories like creating a branch, merge a branch, or other commands.

Commandos is currently only available on Windows, we plan to add macOS and Linux support when we release version 1.0.
